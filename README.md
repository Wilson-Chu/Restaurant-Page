# Restaurant-Page

A simple restaurant storefront page built with vanilla Javascript, bundled using webpack.
Main learnings: DOM manipulation, CSS/style/image loaders, multi-tab/single-page content refreshing, webpack, intermediate CSS, basic mobile-responsive design

Future improvements: implement better mobile menu for more topics (hamburger menu), use drop-down menu if more sections on navbar are needed, update homepage with image slider of sample products
